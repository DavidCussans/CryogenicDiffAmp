# CryogenicDiffAmp

Differential amplifier that can be operated at LAr temperatures. Based on SiGe transistors

Simulation model at the moment

Uses Kicad for schematic entry and ngspice for simulation

differentialAmplifier.sch - simple differential amplifier based on BFP650 SiGe Bipolar junction transistors

differential_bfp_amp_hierarchy.sch - two differential amplifiers configured as a differential current sensitive ampliifer connected to a single buffer amplifier. Powered over cable.

SiPM_model/SiPM_model.{pro,sch,cir} - SiPM model entered into KiCad schematic. ( N.B. Model needs to be edited after writing to get subcircuit correct)

SiPM_model/SiPM_model_simple.cir - just a current source. No trigger or quench switches. ( N.B. Model needs to be edited after writing to get subcircuit correct)
